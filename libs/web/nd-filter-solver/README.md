# nd-filter-solver

Neutral-density filter solver

## Vision

Implement a dedicated mathematical program solver for a specific use case related to a minimization problem. When working with a limited number of sets of neutral-density filters in combination with a higher number of optical sensors and cameras, the need of mathematical minimization optimization arises.

The implementation of a easy to use user interface with memoization shall be explored.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test nd-filter-solver` to execute the unit tests.
