# Optical Engineering and Photonics Widgets

This project is meant for experimental development of widgets which might be used in a knowledge management project in the future. These widgets are designed to assist knowledge workers in various optical engineering and photonics applications. Use cases might be fairly specific and not applicable to a wider audience.

## Vision/Status

### Widgets (0/1 ready for testing)

1. ND Filter Solver [Exploration]
   Design 🎢 > **Exploration** 🔍 > Mathematical Definition > Prototyping > Implementation > Generalization if required
